Pure Rust host-side YubiKey [Personal Identity Verification (PIV)][1] driver
with general-purpose public-key encryption and signing support.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

YubiKeys are versatile devices and through their PIV support, you can use them
to store a number of RSA (2048/1024) and ECC (NIST P-256/P-384) private keys
with configurable access control policies. Both the signing (RSASSA/ECDSA) and
encryption (PKCS#1v1.5/ECIES) use cases are supported for either key type.

See [Yubico's guide to PIV-enabled YubiKeys][2] for more information
on which devices support PIV and the available functionality.

If you've been wanting to use Rust to sign and/or encrypt stuff using a
private key generated and stored on a Yubikey (with option PIN-based access),
this is the crate you've been after!

One small problem, it's not done yet... ðŸ˜«

But it might be close?

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

- Rust **1.39+**

## Security Warning

No security audits of this crate have ever been performed. Presently it is in
an experimental stage and may still contain high-severity issues.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## History

This library is a Rust translation of the [yubico-piv-tool][3] utility by
Yubico, which was originally written in C. It was mechanically translated
from C into Rust using [Corrode][4], and then subsequently heavily
refactored into safer, more idiomatic Rust.

Note that while this project started as a fork of a [Yubico][5] project,
this fork is **NOT** an official Yubico project and is in no way supported or
endorsed by Yubico.

## Testing

To run the full test suite, you'll need a connected YubiKey NEO/4/5 device in
the default state (i.e. default PIN/PUK).

Tests which run live against a YubiKey device are marked as `#[ignore]` by
default in order to pass when running in a CI environment. To run these
tests locally, invoke the following command:

```
cargo test -- --ignored
```

This crate makes extensive use of the `log` facade to provide detailed
information about what is happening. If you'd like to print this logging
information while running the tests, set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable
to a relevant loglevel (e.g. `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`):

```
RUST_LOG=info cargo test -- --ignored
```

To trace every message sent to/from the card i.e. the raw
Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) messages, use the `trace` log level:

```
running 1 test
[INFO  yubikey_piv::yubikey] trying to connect to reader 'Yubico YubiKey OTP+FIDO+CCID'
[INFO  yubikey_piv::yubikey] connected to 'Yubico YubiKey OTP+FIDO+CCID' successfully
[TRACE yubikey_piv::transaction] >>> [0, 164, 4, 0, 5, 160, 0, 0, 3, 8]
[TRACE yubikey_piv::transaction] <<< [97, 17, 79, 6, 0, 0, 16, 0, 1, 0, 121, 7, 79, 5, 160, 0, 0, 3, 8, 144, 0]
[TRACE yubikey_piv::transaction] >>> [0, 253, 0, 0, 0]
[TRACE yubikey_piv::transaction] <<< [5, 1, 2, 144, 0]
[TRACE yubikey_piv::transaction] >>> [0, 248, 0, 0, 0]
[TRACE yubikey_piv::transaction] <<< [0, 115, 0, 178, 144, 0]
test connect ... ok
```

APDU messages labeled `>>>` are being sent to the YubiKey's internal SmartCard,
and ones labeled `<<<` are the responses.
