Pure Rust host-side YubiKey [Personal Identity Verification (PIV)][1] driver
with general-purpose public-key encryption and signing support.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

YubiKeys are versatile devices and through their PIV support, you can use them
to store a number of RSA (2048/1024) and ECC (NIST P-256/P-384) private keys
with configurable access control policies. Both the signing (RSASSA/ECDSA) and
encryption (PKCS#1v1.5/ECIES) use cases are supported for either key type.

If you've been wanting to use Rust to sign and/or encrypt stuff using a
private key generated and stored on a Yubikey (with option PIN-based access),
this is the crate you've been after!

One small problem, it's not done yet... ðŸ˜«

But it might be close?

## History

This library is a Rust translation of the [yubico-piv-tool][2] utility by
Yubico, which was originally written in C. It was mechanically translated
from C into Rust using [Corrode][3], and then subsequently heavily
refactored into safer, more idiomatic RustÂ§.

Note that while this project started as a fork of a [Yubico][4] project,
this fork is **NOT** an official Yubico project and is in no way supported or
endorsed by Yubico.

Â§ *NOTE*: This section is actually full of lies and notes aspirations/goals,
  not history. That said, there's been a decent amount of work cleaning up the
  mechanically translated code, and at ~5klocs it's not that much.

## Security Warning

No security audits of this crate have ever been performed, and it has not been
thoroughly assessed to ensure its operation is constant-time on common CPU
architectures.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Requirements

- Rust 1.39+
